**Title:** *Crisis Communication on Social Media: An NLP-Based Analysis
of Firm Responses Using Twitter/X Data*

**1. Introduction**

Crises such as product recalls, cybersecurity breaches, and supply chain
disruptions significantly impact firms' reputations. With the rise of
social media, companies increasingly rely on platforms like Twitter/X to
communicate with stakeholders in real time. However, the effectiveness
of these digital communication strategies remains poorly understood in
the Information Systems (IS) literature.

This study proposes to use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to
analyze firms' crisis communication strategies on Twitter/X. By
examining the **sentiment, emotional tone, and public engagement** of
crisis-related tweets, we aim to uncover which strategies mitigate
public backlash and rebuild trust.

**2. Research Questions**

1.  How do firms use Twitter/X to communicate during crises?

2.  What types of sentiment and emotional tones are associated with
    higher public engagement?

3.  Do empathetic communication strategies reduce negative public
    sentiment compared to defensive or neutral ones?

4.  Can sentiment and emotion analysis predict the effectiveness of
    crisis communication strategies?

**3. Methodology**

**3.1 Data Collection**

-   **Source**: Twitter/X.

-   **Tool**: snscrape (no API required) or Tweepy (if API key
    available).

-   **Target Data**: Tweets posted by selected firms during known crises
    (e.g., Toyota recalls, Equifax data breach).

-   **Data Points**: Tweet text, date, likes, retweets, replies,
    hashtags, mentions.

Python automation with AI assistant:

-   Script generation for scraping.

-   Automatic cleaning & labeling of firm tweets vs public replies.

**3.2 Preprocessing**

-   Cleaning: Remove hashtags, mentions, URLs.

-   Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization (spaCy, NLTK).

-   Storage in structured format (pandas, SQLite).

**3.3 Analysis**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis**

    -   VADER for polarity scores (positive, negative, neutral).

2.  **Emotion Detection**

    -   NRCLex or Hugging Face models (e.g.,
        twitter-roberta-base-sentiment, GoEmotions).

3.  **Engagement Analysis**

    -   Statistical correlation between firm tweet tone and public
        engagement (likes, retweets).

4.  **Crisis Communication Effectiveness**

    -   Compare sentiment/emotion of **firm tweets** with
        **sentiment/emotion of replies**.

    -   Build a machine learning classifier (scikit-learn, XGBoost) to
        predict engagement effectiveness.

**3.4 Validation**

-   Use multiple crises from different industries (automotive, finance,
    healthcare).

-   Compare patterns across sectors to ensure robustness.

**4. Expected Contributions**

**Theoretical**

-   Extend IS research by providing **computational evidence** on
    digital crisis communication.

-   Contribute to literature on **social media as an information
    system** for organizational reputation management.

**Practical**

-   Provide managers with **data-driven insights** on effective crisis
    messaging.

-   Offer a Python-based **dashboard prototype** for real-time
    monitoring of sentiment during crises.

**5. Tools & Implementation Plan (Python only)**

-   **Data Collection**: snscrape, Tweepy

-   **Preprocessing**: pandas, NLTK, spaCy

-   **Sentiment/Emotion**: VADER, NRCLex, Hugging Face Transformers

-   **Modeling**: scikit-learn, XGBoost

-   **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly

-   **AI Assistant Support**:

    -   Generate Python scripts for scraping/analysis.

    -   Automate text cleaning and sentiment extraction.

    -   Create visualizations and draft result summaries.

    -   Assist in writing methodology & results sections.

**6. Timeline (4--5 months)**

-   **Month 1**: Literature review, finalize crisis events, set up data
    scraping.

-   **Month 2**: Data collection + preprocessing pipeline.

-   **Month 3**: Sentiment & emotion analysis + engagement metrics.

-   **Month 4**: Modeling + result visualization.

-   **Month 5**: Write-up + submission to journal (DSS, ISF, JMIS).
